        "1.) Enter the names of the bot types you want to modify into the bot_types_to_modify entry.": "//",
        "2.) Set enabled to true": "//",
        "3.) Save the file.": "//",
        "4.) Run the game. You need to get at least as far as the main menu.": "//",
        "5.) Close the game, and re-open this file.": "//",
        "6.) The bot_weapon_settings entry will now be populated with a list of weapons for every bot whose name you entered into bot_types_to_modify. Change the values for the weapons you're interested in.": "//",
        "7.) Save the file.": "//",
        "8.) Run AKI again. All your changes should now be applied.": "//",

        "############## spawn_chance_weight is the relative chance that that type of bot will spawn with that weapon. A weapon with a value of 3 is 3 times as likely to spawn as a weapon with a value of 1. A weapon with a value of 10 is 2 times as likely to spawn as a weapon with a value of 5. Note: I'm not entirely certain that this system is perfect. It's possible there are other factors that weight weapon selection one way or another, but my testing indicates that this does significantly influence it.##############": "//",
