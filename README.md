# spt-aki_personal-modding
The source code for SPT AKI (Escape From Tarkov Single Player mod) with additional mods and my own tweaks.

The source code is found at the following link: https://www.sp-tarkov.com/ (current version: 2.3.1). I claim no ownership of the files and use this git project to showcase my activity as an occasional modder and to track my own changes (in case I wish to rewind).

Any mods I download and add are from the SPT AKI workshop (https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/). The same applies here: I claime no ownsership on any files found on my repository (under user/mods). Some of these mods allow tweaking the configuration files; this repo allows tracking the changes I personally make.

The goal of this repository is for me to craft a Tarkov experience in which I can thrive and have fun with, away from the averse effects stemming from competitve first-person shooters (mainly, allowing for exploration VS competition; removing the notion of meta; having the freedom to implement my own vision of quest and character progression in a single player environment; fuffing around in a sandbox type game with the tools allowing for customization).

If I have infringed any rights by putting this up on github (again, for personal use versionning, mainly), please do let me know by email (axel.e.cante@gmail.com) and I will take this repo down immediately.

-----------

I made small to medium-sized changed to most aspects of the game which are accessible within the JavaScript SPT-AKI framework. I made no changed to the game's engine.

Tweaks include things like shop prices/availabilities, enemy behaviors, quests and progression, map spawn points, etc.
